# DeepSeek Harness (dsh) Tool Mapping

Skills speak in actions ("dispatch a subagent", "create a todo", "read a file"). On the DeepSeek Harness these resolve to the tools below. The same mapping is inlined into the bootstrap the dsh plugin injects each session — keep both in sync when either changes.

| Action skills request | dsh equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Invoke a skill | The `skill` tool, with the exact kebab-case skill name (`brainstorming`, `test-driven-development`) |
| Create a todo / mark complete (`TodoWrite`) | `todo_write` |
| Read a file | `read` |
| Create a file | `write` |
| Edit a file | `edit` |
| Delete a file | `pwsh` on Windows, `bash` on Unix |
| Run a shell command (`Bash`) | `pwsh` on Windows, `bash` on Unix; `run_in_background: true` for long commands, then `job_output` / `job_kill` |
| Search file contents (`Grep`) | `grep` |
| Find files by name (`Glob`) | `glob` |
| Fetch a URL (`WebFetch`) / search the web | `web_search`; `read_page` when that tool is available for one specific page |
| Dispatch a subagent (`Task (general-purpose):`, `Subagent (general-purpose):`) | `subagent` (background by default) or `subagent_fork` when the child must inherit this conversation; `workflow` for large planned fan-outs; `ralph` when a fresh agent must iterate on one objective |
| Ask your human partner a question | `ask_user_question` |
| Present a plan for approval | dsh plan mode — `exit_plan_mode` hands the plan to your human partner |
| Track a long-running objective | The goal tools: `create_goal`, `get_goal`, `update_goal` |

## Skills

dsh has a native skill system: this plugin registers Superpowers' `skills/` directory as a skill provider, so the skill catalog the session receives lists every Superpowers skill and the `skill` tool loads one by name. Names carry no `superpowers:` prefix on dsh — `superpowers:brainstorming` in older prose is simply `brainstorming` here.

Loading a skill's `SKILL.md` with `read` is **not** the mechanism on dsh. Use the `skill` tool; it returns the same body plus the base directory that the skill's relative resources (`scripts/…`, `references/…`, `*-prompt.md`) resolve against.

The `using-superpowers` skill is injected as the session's bootstrap and is already active — do not spend a `skill` call re-loading it.

## Subagents

dsh ships `subagent` (a separate agent with its own context; background by default, continuable with `send_message`) and `subagent_fork` (a child seeded with the current conversation). Superpowers' `subagent-driven-development`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, and `requesting-code-review` skills work with either: dispatch one subagent per task, give it the complete task text and the review prompts the skill names, and act on the report it returns. `workflow` runs a JavaScript script that fans work out across many subagents when the plan calls for large-scale parallel work.

## Task lists

`todo_write` is dsh's task list. Superpowers skills that mention `TodoWrite` (or "create a todo per item") mean this tool: send the complete list on every call, one item per checklist entry, and mark an item complete the moment it is done.

## Background work

Long shell commands and agents run as managed background jobs. Start them with `run_in_background: true`, read progress with `job_output` (use `wait: true` only when genuinely blocked), and stop them with `job_kill`. Never busy-poll a job you started.
